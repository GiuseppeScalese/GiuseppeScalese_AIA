Run the index.html page and check the test out.

The test has been implemented both on Google Chrome and Firefox. It is fully responsive - mobile version availale.
Also, the test is IE compatible. IE9(included) onwards.

I've used SASS, HTML5 and GRUNT as task runner.

From the terminal, run "GRUNT" in order to compile the whole project running all tasks.
Otherwise run each task singularly.
